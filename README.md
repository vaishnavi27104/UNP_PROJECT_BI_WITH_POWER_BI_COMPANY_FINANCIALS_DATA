# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze company financials. The dataset was carefully prepared by removing unnecessary columns such as Month Name and Day, correcting data types, and establishing key financial relationships, including Profit = Sales - COGS and Sales = Gross Sales - Discount. The dashboard tracks essential KPIs such as Total COGS, Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Discount, and Total Units Sold, providing valuable insights into sales performance, discount impact, and profitability trends to support data-driven decision-making. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, financial analysis, and Power BI visualization, enhancing my ability to interpret financial data effectively. The project files have been submitted on GitHub for reference and further development.
